Once upon a time there lived a young lad named Billy.
Young Billy had one fear, the Monster under his bed.
This was until one day Billy mustered the strength to slay the Monster.
It was quite noble as everyone knows that Billy prefers RedBull.

Billy got to work in making his armour.
He tied a pot to his head and pans to his chest.
He covered his arms and legs in cardboard.
Young Billy took out the biggest kitchen knife he could find for his sword.
